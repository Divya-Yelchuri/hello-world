This is an example of creating a file in master branch and adding it to remote repository hw.

My remote repository Hello-world had already had some data (README.md) file so it was not synching with my local repository master(master of Projdet) so i had to force push it to see changes of projdetails.txt file in hello-world remote rpository.

the command is :

git push -f <remote repository url name> <local repository master>

-f option means to force when used with push it forcefully overrides the data in remote repository with data in loccal repository.
