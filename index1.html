This is an experiment to create a file "index1.html" in DW branch of my local repo "practproj" and push it remote repo new branch NB (hw/NB)

note : We cannot create a branch of remote repo from git bash instead we can push our local repo branch to remote repo.Then send a pull request to merge our branch with remote repo master.
